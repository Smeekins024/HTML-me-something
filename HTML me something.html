               <h2>Thundercankles</h2>
               <p>Thundercankles was the first time i played kickball during the winter. Sounds like a rough time, but due to it being St. louis winters, we still had a decent mix of snow and good weather games. It was also only my second season playing so i was still learning the game, but also making some lifelong friends in the process.</p>

               <h2>They Dead</h2>
               <p>They Dead was my first time being in a draft style kickball league. I was picked in the second round so i felt pretty good about that. </p>

                  <h2>WhisperingEye</h2>
                  <p>Whispering Eye was the first team that I had come to that had already been established. They were all family members so their chemistry was always top notch.</p>
