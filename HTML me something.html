               <h2>Thundercankles</h2>
               <p>Thundercankles was the first time i played kickball during the winter. Sounds like a rough time, but due to it being St. louis winters, we still had a decent mix of snow and good weather games. It was also only my second season playing so i was still learning the game, but also making some lifelong friends in the process.</p>
